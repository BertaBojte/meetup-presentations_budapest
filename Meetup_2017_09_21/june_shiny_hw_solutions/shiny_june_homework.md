## Homework assignments after shiny session 2016-06-21

### Questions (you may submit any subset):

- Show the current value of the period slider with a `textOutput` and `renderText`, in the `sidebarPanel`, below the slider.
- Add the option of filtering for an arbitrary subset of countries. (Hint: use `checkboxGroupInput`)
- Add a new tab with a plot on ratio of all births by education, regardless of mother's age. (Hint: for aggregating you can use `dplyr::group_by` and `dplyr::summarise`)
- Create an entirely new shiny app which uses a built-in dataset, e.g. diamonds. Show an arbitrary plot of your choice.
